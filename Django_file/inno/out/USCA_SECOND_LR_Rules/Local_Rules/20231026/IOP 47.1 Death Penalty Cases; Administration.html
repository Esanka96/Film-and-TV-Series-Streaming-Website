case
within
this
circuit
with
a
scheduled
execution
date,
and
to
communicate
with
all
parties
and
relevant
state
and
federal
courts.
If
the

will
docket
the

the
miscellaneous
docket
case
upon
the

case
pool
consists
of
all
active
judges
of
the
court
and
those
senior
judges
who
have
filed
with
the
clerk
a
statement
of
willingness

Selection.
</strong>The
clerk
assigns
judges
to
death
penalty
case
panels
by
random
drawing
from
the
death
penalty
case
pool.
If
a
judge
is
unable
to
serve,
that
judge's
name
returns
to
the
pool
after
the
drawing
of
a
replacement.
If
a
random
drawing
results
in
the
selection
of
three
senior
judges,
the
clerk
sets
aside
the
third
senior
judge's
name
and
continues
drawing
until
the
selection
of
an
active
judge's
name,
after
which
the
clerk
returns
the
third
senior
judge's
name,
and
the
names
of
any
senior
judges
drawn
thereafter,
to
the
pool.</p>

Rotation.
</strong>A
judge
who
serves
on
a
death
penalty
case
panel
is
not
eligible
to
serve
again
until
the
pool
is
exhausted.
When
the
pool
is
exhausted,
the
clerk
prepares
a
new
death
penalty
case
pool
and
selects
death
penalty
case
panels
from
the
pool
in
like
manner.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1"><strong>(5)
Replacement.
</strong>If
any
judge
serving
on
a
death
penalty
case
panel
is
unable
to
continue
to
serve,
the
clerk
draws
a
replacement
from
the
death
penalty
case
pool,
and
returns
the
replaced
judge's
name
to
the
pool.</p>
