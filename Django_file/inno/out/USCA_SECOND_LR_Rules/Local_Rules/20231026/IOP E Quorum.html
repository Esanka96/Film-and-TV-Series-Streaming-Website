<p>(a)
A
quorum
is
a
majority
of
a
panel
or
of
the
court
en
banc.
See
28
U.S.C.
ยง
46.
If
less
than
a
quorum
is
present
at
any
court
session,
any
judge
who
attends
may
adjourn
the
session,
or,
if
no
judge
is
present,
the
clerk
may
adjourn
the
session.<br/>
<br/>
(b)
After
a
matter
has
been
assigned
to
a
three-judge
panel,
if
for
any
reason
a
panel
judge
ceases
to
participate
in
consideration
of
the
matter,
the
two
remaining
judges
may
--
if
they
agree
--
decide
the
matter,
or
may
request
the
clerk
to
designate
a
third
judge
by
random
selection.
If
a
third
judge
is
designated,
the
clerk
will
advise
the
parties.
Additional
briefs
and
argument
are
not
permitted
unless
the
court
orders
otherwise.<br/>
