<p><strong>(a)
Request
to
This
Court
for
a
COA.</strong>
In
a
case
governed
by
28
U.S.C.
ยง
2253
and
FRAP
22(b),
this
court
will
not
act
on
a
request
for
a
certificate
of
appealability
(COA)
unless
the
district
court
has
denied
a
COA.
If
the
district
court
denies
a
COA,
the
applicant
must,
within
28
days
after
the
later
of
that
denial
or
the
filing
of
the
notice
of
appeal,
request
a
COA
in
this
court.
The
request
must
include
a
copy
of
the
district
judge's
order
denying
the
COA,
and
a
statement
that
(1)
identifies
each
issue
that
the
applicant
intends
to
raise
on
appeal
and
the
relevant
facts,
and
(2)
makes
a
substantial
showing
of
a
denial
of
a
constitutional
right
as
to
each
issue.
A
request
to
this
court
for
a
COA
is
decided
without
oral
argument.
The
court
ordinarily
limits
its
consideration
of
the
request
to
the
issues
identified
in
the
request.
The
appeal
may
not
proceed
unless
a
COA
has
been
issued.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(b)
Timing.</strong>
If
a
COA
issues,
the
later
of
that
date
or
the
filing
of
the
notice
of
appeal
serves
as
the
date
of
the
notice
of
appeal
for
calculating
time
under
FRAP
and
these
Local
Rules.</p>
