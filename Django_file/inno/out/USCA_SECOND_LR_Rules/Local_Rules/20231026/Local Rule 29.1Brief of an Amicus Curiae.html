<p><strong>(a)
Leave
to
File.</strong>
The

ordinarily
will
deny
leave

when,
by
reason
of
a
relationship
between
a
judge
assigned
to
hear
the
proceeding
and
the
amicus
curiae
or
its
counsel,
the
filing
of
the
brief
might
cause
the
recusal
of
the
judge.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(b)
Disclosure.</strong>
The
required
disclosure
statement
under
FRAP
29(a)(4)(E)
must
appear
in
the
first
footnote
on
the
first
page
of
the
brief.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(c)
Amicus
Brief
Length
Limitation.</strong>
An
amicus
brief
filed
under
FRAP
29(a)
is
acceptable
if
it
is
no
more
than
one-half
the
maximum
length
authorized
by
these
local
rules
for
a
party's
principal
brief.</p>
