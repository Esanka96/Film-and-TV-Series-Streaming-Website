<h1>Local Rule 34.1. Oral Argument and Submission on Briefs</h1><td
class="subpage_text">
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(a)
Oral
Argument
Statement.</strong>
Within
14
days
after
the
filing
of
the
last
appellee's
brief,
each
party
must
file
an
Oral
Argument
Statement
Form.
Failure
to
timely
file
the
Oral
Argument
Statement
Form
signifies
that
the
party
does
not
seek
oral
argument.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(b)
Court's
Determination
Not
to
Hear
Oral
Argument.</strong>
The
court
may
determine
to
take
a
case
on
submission,
without
oral
argument,
in
accordance
with
FRAP
34(a)(2).
If
the
court
decides
to
take
a
case
on
submission,
the
clerk
will
notify
the
parties.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(c)
Number
of
Counsel.</strong>
Only
one
counsel
may
argue
for
each
party
unless
the
court
orders
otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(d)
Time
Allotments.</strong>
The
clerk
notifies
the
parties
of
the
argument
time
the
court
has
allotted
to
each
side.
If
there
are
multiple
parties
on
the
same
side
of
an
appeal,
the
court
may
require
the
parties
to
divide
the
time
allotted
to
that
side.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(e)
Postponement
of
Argument.</strong>
After
a
case
has
been
set
for
oral
argument,
it
may
be
postponed
only
by
order
of
the
court
on
a
showing
of
extraordinary
circumstances,
and
not
by
stipulation
of
the
parties.
Engagement
of
counsel
in
another
tribunal
(other
than
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court)
is
not
an
extraordinary
circumstance.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(f)
Exception.</strong>
This
rule
does
not
apply
to
a
case
placed
on
the
Non-Argument
Calendar
under
LR
34.2.</p>
