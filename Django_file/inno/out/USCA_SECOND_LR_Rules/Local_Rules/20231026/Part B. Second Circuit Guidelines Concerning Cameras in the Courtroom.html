<p>
</p>
<p>Pursuant
to
a
resolution
of
the
Judicial
Conference
of
the
United
States
adopted
on
March

1996,
authorizing
each

of

to
"decide
for
itself
whether
to
permit
the
taking
of
photographs
and
radio
and
television
coverage
of
appellate
arguments,
subject
to
any
restrictions
in
statutes,
national
and
local
rules,
and
such

as
the
Judicial
Conference
may
adopt,"
the
Court
hereby
adopts
the
following
Guidelines:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>1.
Exercise
of
local
option.
From
the
date
of
these
Guidelines
until
further
order
of
this
Court,
proceedings
of
the
Court
conducted
in
open
court
may
be
covered
by
the
media
using
a
television
camera,
sound
recording
equipment,
and
a
still
camera
(hereafter
referred
to
a
"camera
coverage"),
subject
to
these
Guidelines.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>2.
Applicable
guidelines.
Camera
coverage
must
be
conducted
in
conformity
with
applicable
statutes,
national
rules,
any
guidelines
that
may
be
issued
by
the
U.S.
Judicial
Conference,
and
these
Guidelines
of
the
Second
Circuit
Court
of
Appeals.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>3.
Eligible
proceedings.
Camera
coverage
is
allowed
for
all
proceedings
conducted
in
open
court,
except
for
criminal
matters.
See
Fed.
R.
Crim.
P.
53,
54(a).
For
purposes
of
these
Guidelines,
"criminal
matters"
include
not
only
direct
appeals
of
criminal
convictions
but
also
any
appeal,
motion,
or
petition
challenging
a
ruling
made
in
connection
with
a
criminal
case
(such
as
bail
motions
or
appeals
from
the
dismissal
of
an
indictment)
and
any
appeal
from
a
ruling
concerning
a
post-conviction
remedy
(such
as
a
habeas
corpus
petition).
Camera
coverage
is
not
permitted
for
pro
se
matters,
whether
criminal
or
civil.
On
any
day
when
camera
coverage
is
to
occur,
the
Clerk's
Office
will
endeavor
to
schedule
civil
and
non-pro
se
matters
ahead
of
criminal
and
pro
se
matters.
Camera
coverage
operators
will
remain
seated,
away
from
their
equipment,
and
their
equipment
will
be
turned
off,
during
criminal
and
pro
se
proceedings.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>4.
News
media
pooling.
Camera
coverage
will
be
permitted
by
any
person
or
entity
regularly
engaged
in
the
gathering
and
dissemination
of
news
(hereinafter
"news
media").
If
coverage
is
sought
by
more
than
one
person
or
entity,
a
pool
system
must
be
used
(one
for
still
photography
and
one
for
radio
and
television).
It
will
be
the
responsibility
of
the
news
media
to
resolve
any
disputes
among
them
as
to
which
personnel
will
operate
equipment
in
the
courtroom.
In
the
absence
of
an
agreement,
camera
coverage
will
not
be
permitted
for
that
day's
proceedings.
The
television
pictures,
audio
signals,
and
still
photographs
of
court
proceedings
made
by
pool
personnel
must
be
made
available
to
any
news
media
requesting
them
upon
payment
of
a
reasonable
fee
to
the
employer
of
the
pool
personnel
to
share
the
costs
of
the
pool
personnel.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>5.
Educational
institutions.
The
Court
may
also
authorize
the
coverage
of
court
proceedings
and
access
to
pooled
coverage
by
educational
institutions.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>6.
Prior
notification
requirement.
News
media
interested
in
camera
coverage
of
any
court
proceeding
must
notify
the
Court's
calendar

days
preceding

to

or

Friday
for

For

of
a
particular
