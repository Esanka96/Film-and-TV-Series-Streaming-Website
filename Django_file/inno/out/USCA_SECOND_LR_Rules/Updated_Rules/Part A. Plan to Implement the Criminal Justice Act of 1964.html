JUSTICE
ACT
OF

Effective
Date
March

</p>
<p>

<p>Under
the

Act
(CJA)
of

Guide

Judiciary
Policy,
Volume
7A</a>,
the
United
States
Court
of
Appeals
for
the
Second
Circuit
adopts
this
Plan
for
furnishing
representation
in
the
Court
of
Appeals
for
any
person
financially
unable
to
obtain
adequate
representation
consistent
with
the
CJA.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>I.
STATEMENT
OF
POLICY</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
objectives
of
this
Plan
are
to
attain
the
goal
of
equal
justice
under
the
law
for
all
persons;
to
provide
all
eligible
persons
with
timely
appointed
counsel
services
that
are
consistent
with
the
best
practices
of
the
legal
profession,
are
cost
effective,
and
protect
the
independence
of
the
defense
function
so
that
the
rights
of
individual
defendants
are
safeguarded
and
enforced;
and
to
particularize
the
requirements
of
the
CJA,
the
USA
Patriot
Improvement
and
Reauthorization
Act
of
2005
(recodified
at
18
U.S.C.
Â§
3599),
and
the
Guide,
Vol.
7A,
in
a
way
that
meets
the
needs
of
this
Court.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This
Plan
must
therefore
be
administered
so
that
those
accused
of
a
crime,
or
otherwise
eligible
for
services
under
the
CJA,
will
not
be
deprived
of
the
right
to
counsel,
or
any
element
of
representation
necessary
to
an
effective
defense,
due
to
lack
of
financial
resources.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>To
ensure
compliance
with
this
Plan,
the
Court,
the
Clerk
of
Court,
all
federal
public
defender
or
community
defender
organizations,
attorneys
provided
by
a
bar
association
or
legal
aid
agency,
and
private
attorneys
appointed
under
the
CJA
must
comply
with
the
Guide,
Vol.
7A,
approved
by
the
Judicial
Conference
of
the
United
States
or
its
Committee
on
Defender
Services,
and
with
this
Plan.
The
Court
will
also
ensure
that
a
current
copy
of
this
Plan
is
made
available
on
the
Courtâs
website
and
provided
to
CJA
counsel
upon
the
attorneyâs
designation
as
a
member
of
the
CJA
panel
of
private
attorneys
(âCJA
panelâ).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>II.
PREPARATION
AND
MAINTENANCE
OF
CJA
PANEL</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>A.
</strong>
Appointment
to
the
CJA
Panel.
<br/>
<p>
</p>
1.
The
Court
administers
this
Plan
with
the
assistance
of
the
Courtâs
CJA
Committee
and
the
Court-appointed
CJA
Attorney
Advisory
Group
(âAAGâ).
The
AAG
primarily
reviews
applications
for
membership
on
the
CJA
panel
and
otherwise
promotes
the
furnishing
of
representation
pursuant
to
this
Plan.
The
AAG
consists
of
the
Attorney-in-Charge
of
the
Appeals
Bureau
of
the
Federal
Defenders
of
New
York
and
twelve
other
attorneys
selected
by
the
Court
for
terms
not
to
exceed
three
years
who
will
collectively
represent
all
the
districts
in
the
Circuit.
The
members
of
the
AAG
must
be
admitted
to
practice
in
this
Court
and
may
not
be
members
of
the
CJA
panel.
<br/><br/>
2.
In
death
penalty
appeals,
the
Chair
of
the
CJA
Committee
must
consult
with
the
Chair
of
the
AAG
and
either
the
relevant
districtâs
Federal
Public
Defender
organization
or
the
Defender
Services
Office
of
the
Administrative
Office
of
the
United
States
Courts
(AO)
regarding
the
appointment
of
learned
counsel
and
additional
counsel.<br/><br/>
3.
A
private
attorney
seeking
to
be
included
on
the
CJA
panel
must
apply
for
membership
on
the
panel.
When
seeking
applications
to
the
panel,
the
Court
publishes
an
announcement
on
the
Second
Circuit
Court
of
Appeals
website
with
application
instructions.
Applicants
must
be
members
in
good
standing
of
the
bar
of
the
Court,
and
must
have
demonstrated
experience
in
and
knowledge
of
Title
18
and
the
habeas
corpus
provisions
of
Title
28
of
the
United
States
Code,
the
Federal
Rules
of
Appellate
Procedure
(FRAP),
the
Federal
Rules
of
Criminal
Procedure,
the
Federal
Rules
of
Evidence,
the
<a
href="https://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/clerk/case_filing/rules/local_rules.html"
style="color:

Courtâs
Local
Rules</a>
(LRs)
and
Internal
Operating
Procedures
(IOPs),
the
United
States
Sentencing
Guidelines,
and
other
relevant
federal
law.
<br/><br/>
4.
The
Court
appoints
attorneys
to
the
CJA
panel
upon
appropriate
recommendation
from
the
Committee,
after
consultation
with
the
AAG.
Panel
members
are
selected
based
on
demonstrated
qualification,
skill,
and
dedication.
One
factor
in
selection
is
whether
the
applicant
maintains
an
office
within
the
Circuit.<br/><br/>
5.
CJA
panel
members
serve
for
a
term
not
to
exceed
three
years,
but
may
be
removed
by
the
Court
prior
to
the
expiration
of
their
term.
Terms
are
staggered
so
that
the
terms
of
approximately
one-third
of
panel
members
expire
each
year.
Upon
expiration
of
his
or
her
term,
a
CJA
panel
member
must
reapply
for
membership
to
continue
as
a
member
of
the
CJA
panel.<br/><br/>
6.
The
Clerk
of
Court
maintains
a
list
of
CJA
panel
members.
Attorneys
appointed
to
the
CJA
panel
must
notify
the
Clerk
of
Court
within
48
hours
of
any
changes
in
business
address,
business
telephone
number,
e-mail
address,
or
employment.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>B.
</strong>Removal
from
the
CJA
Panel.</p>
<p>
</p>
1.
The
Court
may
remove
a
CJA
panel
member
from
the
CJA
panel
if
it
determines
that
the
member
has
failed
to
satisfactorily
fulfill
the
obligations
of
panel
membership,
including
the
duty
to
afford
competent
counsel,
or
that
the
member
has
engaged
in
other
conduct
that
renders
inappropriate
the
attorneyâs
continued
service
on
the
CJA
panel.<br/><br/>
2.
The
Court
may
remove
a
CJA
panel
member
for
refusing
to
serve
as
appointed
counsel
for
three
separate
cases
during
the
membership
term.<br/><br/>
3.
A
CJA
panel
member
is
suspended
automatically
if
the
member
is
disbarred
or
suspended
by
any
state
or
federal
bar,
or
is
arrested
for,
charged
with,
or
convicted
of
a
crime.
A
CJA
panel
member
must
notify
the
Clerk
of
Court
in
writing
within
24
hours
of
any
such
suspension,
disbarment,
arrest,
or
filing
of
criminal
charges
or
conviction.
See
also
LR
46.2.
Disbarment
or
suspension
by
any
state
or
federal
bar
or
conviction
of
a
crime
also
constitutes
grounds
for
automatic
removal
from
the
CJA
panel.
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>C.
</strong><br/><br/>Complaints
concerning
the
conduct
of
CJA
panel
members
should
be
submitted
to
the
Clerk
of
Court.
If
the
CJA
Committee
determines
that
a
complaint
alleges
facts
that,
if
true,
would
warrant
consideration
of
removal
of
the
CJA
panel
member,
or
that
other
facts
exist
potentially
warranting
removal
of
a
panel
member,
the
CJA
Committee
may
direct
the
AAG
to
review
the
complaint,
or
make
such
other
inquiry
as
it
deems
appropriate,
and
to
issue
a
report
of
its
findings
and
recommendations
to
the
Committee.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>D.
</strong><br/><br/>
CJA
panel
members
may
select,
with
acquiescence
from
the
Chief
Judge,
a
member
of
the
CJA
panel
to
serve
as
the
CJA
panel
representative
to
the
Court.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>III.
DETERMINATION
OF
NEED
FOR
APPOINTED
COUNSEL</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>A.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In
all
cases
in
which
the
district
court
found
the
defendant
to
be
financially
unable
to
obtain
adequate
representation,
the
Court
may
accept
this
finding
and
appoint
or
continue
an
attorney
without
further
proof,
except
as
noted
in
FRAP
24(a)(3).
If
the
defendant
appears
pro
se,
the
Clerk
of
Court
must
notify
the
defendant
that
he
or
she
has
a
right
to
the
appointment
of
an
attorney
under
the
CJA.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>B.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When
a
request
for
the
appointment
of
an
attorney
under
the
CJA
is
made
for
the
first
time
on
appeal,
the
Court
must
find
that
the
CJA
applicant
is
financially
unable
to
retain
counsel
consistent
with
the
Guide,
Vol.
7A
Â§
210.40..</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>C.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
Court
may,
at
any
time
after
the
appointment
of
counsel,
re-examine
the
financial
status
of
a
CJA
client
.
If
the
Court
finds
that
a
CJA
client
is
financially
able
to
obtain
counsel
or
make
partial
payment
for
the
CJA
clientâs
representation,
the
appointment
should
be
terminated,
or
partial
payment
required.
If
a
CJA
attorney
learns
any
information
indicating
that
a
CJA
client
can
make
payment
in
whole
or
in
part
for
legal
services,
the
CJA
attorney
must
report
such
information
promptly
to
the
Clerk
of
Court
so
that
appropriate
action
may
be
taken.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>IV.
APPOINTMENT
OF
COUNSEL</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Counsel
appointed
under
the
CJA
to
represent
a
CJA
client
in
the
district
court
must
continue
such
representation
on
appeal
unless
relieved
by
order
of
the
Court.
See
LR
4.1.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>B.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In
all
cases
on
appeal
in
which
the
CJA
requires
appointment
of
an
attorney,
the
Court
must
appoint
a
CJA
panel
member
to
represent
the
defendant
within
a
reasonable
time
after
the
appeal
is
docketed.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>C.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When
the
Court
determines
that
the
appointment
of
an
attorney
who
is
not
a
member
of
the
CJA
panel
is
appropriate,
the
attorney
may
be
admitted
to
the
CJA
panel
pro
hac
vice
and
appointed
to
represent
the
CJA
client.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>D.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Retained
counsel,
regardless
of
membership
on
the
CJA
panel,
may
seek
to
be
appointed
under
the
CJA
but
must
provide
financial
documentation
as
specified
in
Section
III.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>E.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In
appeals
involving
more
than
one
defendant
entitled
to
representation
under
the
CJA,
the
Court
should
normally
appoint
separate
CJA
counsel
to
represent
each
defendant
unless
the
circumstances
do
not
so
warrant.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>F.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
Court
may,
at
any
point
in
the
appellate
proceedings,
substitute
one
appointed
counsel
for
another.
Total
compensation
to
all
counsel
is
subject
to
the
maximum
permitted
by
the
CJA.
Appointed
counsel
replaced
by
such
substitution
must,
absent
the
Courtâs
approval
of
interim
payment,
await
the
final
disposition
of
the
appeal
before
submitting
a
claim
for
compensation.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>V.

and
of
the
obligation
to
file
a
timely

Form</a>
in
compliance
with
LR
34.1(a).
It
is
expected
that
a
CJA
attorney
will
request
oral
argument
in
most
criminal
appeals.
A
CJA
attorney
must
appear
for
any
scheduled
oral
argument
unless
excused
by
the
Court.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>C.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A
CJA
attorney
must
furnish
all
papers
relating
to
the
CJA
clientâs
appeal
to
the
client,
including
all
the
Courtâs

<p>
</p>
<p><strong>D.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A
CJA
attorney
may
use
and
claim
compensation
for
the
services
of
other
attorneys
as
follows:</p>
<p>
</p>
1.
In
non-capital
cases,
a
CJA
attorney
may
use
and
claim
compensation
for
the
services
of
an
associate
or
partner.
A
CJA
attorney
may
use
and
claim
compensation
for
the
services
of
an
unaffiliated
attorney
only
with
prior
Court
authorization.
The
CJA
attorney
is
expected
to
serve
as
the
lead
attorney
throughout
the
representation.
Claims
for
compensation
must
not
exceed
the
maximum
compensation
allowed
by
the
CJA.<br/><br/>
2.
In
capital
cases,
a
CJA
attorney
may
use
and
claim
compensation
for
the
services
of
attorneys
who
work
in
association
with
them,
with
prior
Court
authorization,
provided
that
the
use
of
such
additional
counsel
diminishes
the
total
cost
of
representation
or
is
required
to
meet
time
limits.
See
Guide,
Vol.
7A
Â§
620.10.
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>E.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In
the
event
of
a
decision
adverse
to
a
CJA
client
in
this
Court,
the
CJA
attorney
must:
promptly
transmit
to
the
CJA
client
a
copy
of
the
Courtâs
decision;
advise
the
CJA
client
in
writing
of
the
right
to
file
a
petition
for
panel
rehearing
or
rehearing
en
banc
in
this
Court
and
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
with
the
United
States
Supreme
Court;
inform
the
CJA
client
of
the
CJA
attorneyâs
opinion
as
to
the
merit
and
likelihood
of
success
of
such
petitions;
and
if
requested
to
do
so,
file
such
petitions.
A
CJA
attorney
who
has
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
a
petition
would
have
no
likelihood
of
success
may
file
a
motion
to
withdraw
under
LR
4.1.
In
the
event
the
CJA
attorney
moves
to
withdraw
after
the
CJA
client
has
requested
that
a
petition
for
rehearing
or
rehearing
en
banc
be
filed,
the
attorney
must
include
in
the
motion
to
withdraw
a
request
on
behalf
of
the
CJA
client
for
an
extension
of
time
of
30
days
for
the
CJA
client
to
petition
pro
se
for
rehearing
or
rehearing
en
banc.
If
the
Court
relieves
the
CJA
attorney,
he
or
she
must,
within
48
hours
after
such
motion
is
granted,
so
advise
the
CJA
client
in
writing
and
inform
the
CJA
client
concerning
the
procedures
for
filing
a
petition
for
panel
rehearing,
rehearing
en
banc,
and
a
writ
of
certiorari
pro
se.</p>
<p>

<p><strong>F.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If
an
adverse
party
petitions
for
panel
rehearing,
rehearing
en
banc,
or
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
this
Court,
the
CJA
attorney
must
take
all
necessary
steps
to
oppose
the
petition.
Unless
the
Court
requests,
no
response
to
a
petition
for
panel
rehearing
or
rehearing
en
banc
is
permitted
to
be
filed.
