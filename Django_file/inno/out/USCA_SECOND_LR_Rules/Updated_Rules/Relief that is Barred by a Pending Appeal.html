of
Appeals.
</strong>If
a
timely
motion
is

an
appeal
that

docketed
and
is
pending,
the
movant
must
promptly
notify
the
circuit
clerk

<p><strong>(b)
Remand
After
an
Indicative
Ruling.
</strong>If
the
district
court
states
that
it
would
grant
the
motion
or
that
the
motion
raises
a
substantial
issue,
the
court
of
appeals
may
remand
for
further
proceedings
but
retains
jurisdiction
unless
it
expressly
dismisses
the
appeal.
If
the
court
of
appeals
remands
but
retains
jurisdiction,
the
parties
must
promptly
notify
the
circuit
clerk
when
the
district
court
has
decided
the
motion
on
remand.</p>
