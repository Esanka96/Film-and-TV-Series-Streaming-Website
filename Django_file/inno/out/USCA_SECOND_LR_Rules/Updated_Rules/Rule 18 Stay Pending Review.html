</p>
<p><strong>(a)
Motion
for
a
Stay.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1"><strong>(1)
Initial
Motion
Before
the
Agency.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">A
petitioner
must
ordinarily
move
first
before
the
agency
for
a
stay
pending
review
of
its
decision
or
order.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1"><strong>(2)
Motion
in
the
Court
of
Appeals.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">A
motion
for
a
stay
may
be
made
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
one
of
its
judges.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent2">(A)
The
motion
must:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent3">(i)
show
that
moving
first
before
the
agency
would
be
impracticable;
or</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent3">(ii)
state
that,
a
motion
having
been
made,
the
agency
denied
the
motion
or
failed
to
afford
the
relief
requested
and
state
any
reasons
given
by
the
agency
for
its
action.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent2">(B)
The
motion
must
also
include:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent3">(i)
the
reasons
for
granting
the
relief
requested
and
the
facts
relied
on;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent3">(ii)
originals
or
copies
of
affidavits
or
other
sworn
statements
supporting
facts
subject
to
dispute;
and</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent3">(iii)
relevant
parts
of
the
record.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent2">(C)
The
moving
party
must
give
reasonable
notice
of
the
motion
to
all
parties.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent2">(D)
The
motion
must
be
filed
with
the
circuit
clerk
and
normally
will
be
considered
by
a
panel
of
the
court.
But
in
an
exceptional
case
in
which
time
requirements
make
that
procedure
impracticable,
the
motion
may
be
made
to
and
considered
by
a
single
judge.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(b)
Bond.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
court
may
condition
relief
on
the
filing
of
a
bond
or
other
appropriate
security.</p>
