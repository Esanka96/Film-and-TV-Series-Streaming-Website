class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(1)
In
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
which
the
detention
complained
of
arises
from
process
issued
by
a
state
court,
or
in
a
28
U.S.C.
§
2255
proceeding,
the
applicant
cannot
take
an
appeal
unless
a
circuit
justice
or
a
circuit
or
district
judge
issues
a
certificate
of
appealability
under
28
U.S.C.
§
2253(c).
If
an
applicant
files
a
notice
of
appeal,
the
district
clerk
must
send
to
the
court
of
appeals
the
certificate
(if
any)
and
the
statement
described
in
Rule
11(a)
of
the
Rules
Governing
Proceedings
Under
28
U.S.C.
§
2254
or
§
2255
(if
any),
along
with
the
notice
of
appeal
and
the
file
of
the
district-court
proceedings.
If
the
district
judge
has
denied
the
certificate,
the
applicant
may
request
a
circuit
judge
to
issue
it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(2)
A
request
addressed
to
the
court
of
appeals
may
be
considered
by
a
circuit
judge
or
judges,
as
the
court
prescribes.
If
no
express
request
for
a
certificate
is
filed,
the
notice
of
appeal
constitutes
a
request
addressed
to
the
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(3)
A
certificate
of
appealability
is
not
required
when
a
state
or
its
representative
or
the
United
States
or
its
representative
appeals.</p>
