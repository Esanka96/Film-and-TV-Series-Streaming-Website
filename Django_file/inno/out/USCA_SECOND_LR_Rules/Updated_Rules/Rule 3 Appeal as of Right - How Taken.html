<span>An
appeal
permitted
by
law
as
of
right
from
a
district
court
to
a
court
of
appeals
may
be
taken
only
by
filing
a
notice
of
appeal
with
the
district
clerk
within
the
time
allowed
by
Rule
4.
At
the
time
of
filing,
the
appellant
must
furnish
the
clerk
with
enough
copies
of
the
notice
to
enable
the
clerk
to
comply
with
Rule

An
appellant's
failure
to
take
any
step
other
than
the
timely
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal
does
not
affect
the
validity
of
the
appeal,
but
is
ground
only
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
act
as
it
considers
appropriate,
including
dismissing
the
appeal.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(3)
An
appeal
from
a
judgment
by
a
magistrate
judge
in
a
civil
case
is
taken
in
the
same
way
as
an
appeal
from
any
other
district
court
judgment.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(4)
An
appeal
by
permission
under
28
U.S.C.
Â§
1292(b)
or
an
appeal
in
a
bankruptcy
case
may
be
taken
only
in
the
manner
prescribed
by
Rules
5
and
6,
respectively.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(b)
Joint
or
Consolidated
Appeals.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(1)
When
two
or
more
parties
are
entitled
to
appeal
from
a
district-court
judgment
or
order,
and
their
interests
make
joinder
practicable,
they
may
file
a
joint
notice
of
appeal.
They
may
then
proceed
on
appeal
as
a
single
appellant.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(2)
When
the
parties
have
filed
separate
timely
notices
of
appeal,
the
appeals
may
be
joined
or
consolidated
by
the
court
of
appeals.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>(c)
Contents
of
the
Notice
of
Appeal.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(1)
The
notice
of
appeal
must:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent2">(A)
specify
the
party
or
parties
taking
the
appeal
by
naming
each
one
in
the
caption
or
body
of
the
notice,
but
an
attorney
representing
more
than
one
party
may
describe
those
parties
with
such
terms
as
"all
plaintiffs,"
"the
defendants,"
"the
plaintiffs
A,
B,
et
al.,"
or
"all
defendants
except
X";</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent2">(B)
designate
the
judgment
â
or
the
appealable
order
â
from
which
the
appeal
is
taken;
and</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent2">(C)
name
the
court
to
which
the
appeal
is
taken.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(2)
A
pro
se
notice
of
appeal
is
considered
filed
on
behalf
of
the
signer
and
the
signer's
spouse
and
minor
children
(if
they
are
parties),
unless
the
notice
clearly
indicates
otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(3)
In
a
class
action,
whether
or
not
the
class
has
been
certified,
the
notice
of
appeal
is
sufficient
if
it
names
one
person
qualified
to
bring
the
appeal
as
representative
of
the
class.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(4)
The
notice
of
appeal
encompasses
all
orders
that,
for
purposes
of
appeal,
merge
into
the
designated
judgment
or
appealable
order.
It
is
not
necessary
to
designate
those
orders
in
the
notice
of
appeal.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(5)
In
a
civil
case,
a
notice
of
appeal
encompasses
the
final
judgment,
whether
or
not
that
judgment
is
set
out
in
a
separate
document
under
Federal
Rule
of
Civil
Procedure
58,
if
the
notice
designates:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent2">(A)
an
order
that
adjudicates
all
remaining
claims
and
the
rights
and
liabilities
of
all
remaining
parties;
or</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent2">(B)
an
order
described
in
Rule
4(a)(4)(A).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(6)
An
appellant
may
designate
only
part
of
a
judgment
or
appealable
order
by
expressly
stating
that
the
notice
of
appeal
is
so
limited.
Without
such
an
express
statement,
specific
designations
do
not
limit
the
scope
of
the
notice
of
appeal.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(7)
An
appeal
must
not
be
dismissed
for
informality
of
form
or
title
of
the
notice
of
appeal,
for
failure
to
name
a
party
whose
intent
to
appeal
is
otherwise
clear
from
the
notice,
or
for
failure
to
properly
designate
the
judgment
if
the
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
after
entry
of
the
judgment
and
designates
an
order
that
merged
into
the
judgment.</p>
<p>

<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(8)
Forms
1A
and
1B
in
the

<p><strong>(d)
Serving
the
Notice
of
Appeal.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(1)
The
district
clerk
must
serve
notice
of
the
filing
of
a
notice
of
appeal
by
sending
a
copy
to
each
party's
counsel
of
record
--
excluding
the
appellant's
--
or,
if
a
party
is
proceeding
pro
se,
to
the
party's
last
known
address.
When
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
appeals,
the
clerk
must
also
serve
a
copy
of
the
notice
of
appeal
on
the
defendant.
The
clerk
must
promptly
send
a
copy
of
the
notice
of
appeal
and
of
the
docket
entries
--
and
any
later
docket
entries
--
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
of
appeals
named
in
the
notice.
The
district
clerk
must
note,
on
each
copy,
the
date
when
the
notice
of
appeal
was
filed.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(2)
If
an
inmate
confined
in
an
institution
files
a
notice
of
appeal
in
the
manner
provided
by
Rule
4(c),
the
district
clerk
must
also
note
the
date
when
the
clerk
docketed
the
notice.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(3)
The
district
clerk's
failure
to
serve
notice
does
not
affect
the
validity
of
the
appeal.
The
clerk
must
note
on
the
docket
the
names
of
the
parties
to
whom
the
clerk
sends
copies,
with
the
date
of
sending.
Service
is
sufficient
despite
the
death
of
a
party
or
the
party's
counsel.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(e)
Payment
of
Fees.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">Upon
filing
a
notice
of
appeal,
the
appellant
must
pay
the
district
clerk
all
required
fees.
The
district
clerk
receives
the
appellate
docket
fee
on
behalf
of
the
court
of
appeals.</p>
