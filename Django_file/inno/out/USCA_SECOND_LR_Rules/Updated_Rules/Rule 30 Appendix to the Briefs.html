<p

filing

under
Rule
30(c),
the
appellant
must
file
10
copies
of
the

with
the

and
must
serve

An

legible
copies
with
the
clerk,
and
one

The

service
of
a
different
number.</p>

<p><strong>(b)
All
Parties'
Responsibilities.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1"><strong>(1)
Determining
the
Contents
of
the
Appendix.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">The
parties
are
encouraged
to
agree
on
the
contents
of
the
appendix.
In
the
absence
of
an
agreement,
the
appellant
must,
within
14
days
after
the
record
is
filed,
serve
on
the
appellee
a
designation
of
the
parts
of
the
record
the
appellant
intends
to
include
in
the
appendix
and
a
statement
of
the
issues
the
appellant
intends
to
present
for
review.
The
appellee
may,
within
14
days
after
receiving
the
designation,
serve
on
the
appellant
a
designation
of
additional
parts
to
which
it
wishes
to
direct
the
court's
attention.
The
appellant
must
include
the
designated
parts
in
the
appendix.
The
parties
must
not
engage
in
unnecessary
designation
of
parts
of
the
record,
because
the
entire
record
is
available
to
the
court.
This
paragraph
applies
also
to
a
cross-appellant
and
a
cross-appellee.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1"><strong>(2)
Costs
of
Appendix.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">Unless
the
parties
agree
otherwise,
the
appellant
must
pay
the
cost
of
the
appendix.
If
the
appellant
considers
parts
of
the
record
designated
by
the
appellee
to
be
unnecessary,
the
appellant
may
advise
the
appellee,
who
must
then
advance
the
cost
of
including
those
parts.
The
cost
of
the
appendix
is
a
taxable
cost.
But
if
any
party
causes
unnecessary
parts
of
the
record
to
be
included
in
the
appendix,
the
court
may
impose
the
cost
of
those
parts
on
that
party.
Each
circuit
must,
by
local
rule,
provide
for
sanctions
against
attorneys
who
unreasonably
and
vexatiously
increase
litigation
costs
by
including
unnecessary
material
in
the
appendix.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(c)
Deferred
Appendix.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1"><strong>(1)
Deferral
Until
After
Briefs
Are
Filed.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">The
court
may
provide
by
rule
for
classes
of
cases
or
by
order
in
a
particular
case
that
preparation
of
the
appendix
may
be
deferred
until
after
the
briefs
have
been
filed
and
that
the
appendix
may
be
filed
21
days
after
the
appellee's
brief
is
served.
Even
though
the
filing
of
the
appendix
may
be
deferred,
Rule
30(b)
applies;
except
that
a
party
must
designate
the
parts
of
the
record
it
wants
included
in
the
appendix
when
it
serves
its
brief,
and
need
not
include
a
statement
of
the
issues
presented.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1"><strong>(2)
References
to
the
Record.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent2">(A)
If
the
deferred
appendix
is
used,
the
parties
may
cite
in
their
briefs
the
pertinent
pages
of
the
record.
When
the
appendix
is
prepared,
the
record
pages
cited
in
the
briefs
must
be
indicated
by
inserting
record
page
numbers,
in
brackets,
at
places
in
the
appendix
where
those
pages
of
the
record
appear.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent2">(B)
A
party
who
wants
to
refer
directly
to
pages
of
the
appendix
may
serve
and
file
copies
of
the
brief
within
the
time
required
by
Rule
31(a),
containing
appropriate
references
to
pertinent
pages
of
the
record.
In
that
event,
within
14
days
after
the
appendix
is
filed,
the
party
must
serve
and
file
copies
of
the
brief,
containing
references
to
the
pages
of
the
appendix
in
place
of
or
in
addition
to
the
references
to
the
pertinent
pages
of
the
record.
Except
for
the
correction
of
typographical
errors,
no
other
changes
may
be
made
to
the
brief.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(d)
Format
of
the
Appendix.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
appendix
must
begin
with
a
table
of
contents
identifying
the
page
at
which
each
part
begins.
The
relevant
docket
entries
must
follow
the
table
of
contents.
Other
parts
of
the
record
must
follow
chronologically.
When
pages
from
the
transcript
of
proceedings
are
placed
in
the
appendix,
the
transcript
page
numbers
must
be
shown
in
brackets
immediately
before
the
included
pages.
Omissions
in
the
text
of
papers
or
of
the
transcript
must
be
indicated
by
asterisks.
Immaterial
formal
matters
(captions,
subscriptions,
acknowledgments,
etc.)
should
be
omitted.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(e)
Reproduction
of
Exhibits.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Exhibits
designated
for
inclusion
in
the
appendix
may
be
reproduced
in
a
separate
volume,
or
volumes,
suitably
indexed.
Four
copies
must
be
filed
with
the
appendix,
and
one
copy
must
be
served
on
counsel
for
each
separately
represented
party.
If
a
transcript
of
a
proceeding
before
an
administrative
agency,
board,
commission,
or
officer
was
used
in
a
district
court
action
and
has
been
designated
for
inclusion
in
the
appendix,
the
transcript
must
be
placed
in
the
appendix
as
an
exhibit.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(f)
Appeal
on
the
Original
Record
Without
an
Appendix.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
court
may,
either
by
rule
for
all
cases
or
classes
of
cases
or
by
order
in
a
particular
case,
dispense
with
the
appendix
and
permit
an
appeal
to
proceed
on
the
original
record
with
any
copies
of
the
record,
or
relevant
parts,
that
the
court
may
order
the
parties
to
file.</p>
