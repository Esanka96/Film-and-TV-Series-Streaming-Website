</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(2)
A
court
of
appeals
that
routinely
considers
cases
on
the
merits
promptly
after
the
briefs
are
filed
may
shorten
the
time
to
serve
and
file
briefs,
either
by
local
rule
or
by
order
in
a
particular
case.</p>
<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>Twenty-five

the
clerk
and
2
copies
must
be
served
on
each
unrepresented
party
and
on
counsel
for
each
separately
represented
party.
An
unrepresented
party
proceeding
in
forma
pauperis
must
file
4
legible
copies

the
clerk,
and
one
copy
must
be
served
on
each

The

require
the

of
a
different
number.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(c)

</p>
<p>If

within
the
time
provided
by
this
rule,
or
within
an
extended
time,
an
appellee
may
move
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
An

who
fails
to
file
a
brief
will
not
be
heard
at
oral
argument
unless
the
court
grants
permission.</p>
