<p>
</p>
<p>The
court
may
direct
the
attorneys
--
and,
when
appropriate,
the
parties
--
to
participate
in
one
or
more
conferences
to
address
any
matter
that
may
aid
in
disposing
of
the
proceedings,
including
simplifying
the
issues
and
discussing
settlement.
A
judge
or
other
person
designated
by
the
court
may
preside
over
the
conference,
which
may
be
conducted
in
person
or
by
telephone.
Before
a
settlement
conference,
the
attorneys
must
consult
with
their
clients
and
obtain
as
much
authority
as
feasible
to
settle
the
case.
The
court
may,
as
a
result
of
the
conference,
enter
an
order
controlling
the
course
of
the
proceedings
or
implementing
any
settlement
agreement.</p>
