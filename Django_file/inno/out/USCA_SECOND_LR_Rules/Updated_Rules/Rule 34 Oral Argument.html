In

</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1"><strong>(1)
Party's
Statement.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">Any
party
may
file,
or
a
court
may
require
by
local
rule,
a
statement
explaining
why
oral
argument
should,
or
need
not,
be
permitted.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1"><strong>(2)
Standards.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">Oral
argument
must
be
allowed
in
every
case
unless
a
panel
of
three
judges
who
have
examined
the
briefs
and
record
unanimously
agrees
that
oral
argument
is
unnecessary
for
any
of
the
following
reasons:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent2">(A)
the
appeal
is
frivolous;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent2">(B)
the
dispositive
issue
or
issues
have
been
authoritatively
decided;
or</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent2">(C)
the
facts
and
legal
arguments
are
adequately
presented
in
the
briefs
and
record,
and
the
decisional
process
would
not
be
significantly
aided
by
oral
argument.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(b)
Notice
of
Argument;
Postponement.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
clerk
must
advise
all
parties
whether
oral
argument
will
be
scheduled,
and,
if
so,
the
date,
time,
and
place
for
it,
and
the
time
allowed
for
each
side.
A
motion
to
postpone
the
argument
or
to
allow
longer
argument
must
be
filed
reasonably
in
advance
of
the
hearing
date.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(c)
Order
and
Contents
of
Argument.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
appellant
opens
and
concludes
the
argument.
Counsel
must
not
read
at
length
from
briefs,
records,
or
authorities.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(d)
Cross-Appeals
and
Separate
Appeals.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If
there
is
a
cross-appeal,
Rule
28.1(b)
determines
which
party
is
the
appellant
and
which
is
the
appellee
for
purposes
of
oral
argument.
Unless
the
court
directs
otherwise,
a
cross-appeal
or
separate
appeal
must
be
argued
when
the
initial
appeal
is
argued.
Separate
parties
should
avoid
duplicative
argument.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(e)
Nonappearance
of
a
Party.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If
the
appellee
fails
to
appear
for
argument,
the
court
must
hear
appellant's
argument.
If
the
appellant
fails
to
appear
for
argument,
the
court
may
hear
the
appellee's
argument.
If
neither
party
appears,
the
case
will
be
decided
on
the
briefs,
unless
the
court
orders
otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(f)
Submission
on
Briefs.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
parties
may
agree
to
submit
a
case
for
decision
on
the
briefs,
but
the
court
may
direct
that
the
case
be
argued.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(g)
Use
of
Physical
Exhibits
at
Argument;
Removal.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Counsel
intending
to
use
physical
exhibits
other
than
documents
at
the
argument
must
arrange
to
place
them
in
the
courtroom
on
the
day
of
the
argument
before
the
court
convenes.
After
the
argument,
counsel
must
remove
the
exhibits
from
the
courtroom,
unless
the
court
directs
otherwise.
The
clerk
may
destroy
or
dispose
of
the
exhibits
if
counsel
does
not
reclaim
them
within
a
reasonable
time
after
the
clerk
gives
notice
to
remove
them.</p>
