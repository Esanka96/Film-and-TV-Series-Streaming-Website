<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(a)
When
Hearing
or
Rehearing
En
Banc
May
Be
Ordered.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A
majority
of
the
circuit
judges
who
are
in
regular
active
service
and
who
are
not
disqualified
may
order
that
an
appeal
or
other
proceeding
be
heard
or
reheard
by
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc.
An
en
banc
hearing
or
rehearing
is
not
favored
and
ordinarily
will
not
be
ordered
unless:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(1)
en
banc
consideration
is
necessary
to
secure
or
maintain
uniformity
of
the
court's
decisions;
or</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(2)
the
proceeding
involves
a
question
of
exceptional
importance.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(b)
Petition
for
Hearing
or
Rehearing
En
Banc.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A
party
may
petition
for
a
hearing
or
rehearing
en
banc.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(1)
The
petition
must
begin
with
a
statement
that
either:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent2">(A)
the
panel
decision
conflicts
with
a
decision
of
the
United
States
Supreme
Court
or
of
the
court
to
which
the
petition
is
addressed
(with
citation
to
the
conflicting
case
or
cases)
and
consideration
by
the
full
court
is
therefore
necessary
to
secure
and
maintain
uniformity
of
the
court's
decisions;
or</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent2">(B)
the
proceeding
involves
one
or
more
questions
of
exceptional
importance,
each
of
which
must
be
concisely
stated;
for
example,
a
petition
may
assert
that
a
proceeding
presents
a
question
of
exceptional
importance
if
it
involves
an
issue
on
which
the
panel
decision
conflicts
with
the
authoritative
decisions
of
other
United
States
Courts
of
Appeals
that
have
addressed
the
issue.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(2)
Except
by
the
court's
permission:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent2">(B)
a

an
en

or

<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(3)
For
purposes
of
the
page
limits
in
Rule
35(b)(2),
if
a
party
files
both
a
petition
for
panel
rehearing
and
a

they
are
considered
a
single

even
if

separately,
unless
separate
filing
is
required
by
local
rule.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(c)

<p>
</p>
<p>No

may
be
filed
to
a

an
en
banc
consideration

</p>
<p>The

<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(f)
