while
a
proceeding
is

on

filed

or
by
any
party.
A
party's
motion
must
be
served
on
the

accordance
with
Rule
25.
If
the
decedent
has
no
representative,

<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">A
public
officer
who
is
a
party
to
an
appeal
or
other
proceeding
in
an
official
capacity
may
be
described
as
a
party
by
the
public
officer's
official
title
rather
than
by
name.
But
the

may
require
the

otherwise
ceases

office,
the
action
does

abate.
The
public
officer's
successor
is
automatically
substituted
as
a
party.
Proceedings
following
the
substitution
are
to
be
in
the
name
of
the
substituted
party,
but
any
misnomer
that
does
not
affect
the
substantial
rights
of
the
parties
may
be
disregarded.
An
order
of
substitution
may
be
entered
at
any
time,
but
failure
to
enter
an
order
does
not
affect
the
substitution.</p>
