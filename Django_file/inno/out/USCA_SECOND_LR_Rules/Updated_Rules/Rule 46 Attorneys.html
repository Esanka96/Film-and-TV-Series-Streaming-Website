class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">A
member
of
the
court's
bar
is
subject
to
suspension
or
disbarment
by

<p>

member
must
be

<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1"><strong>(3)
Order.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p

a
member
of
the
bar

to
comply
with
any
court
rule.
First,
however,
the
court
must
afford
the
attorney
reasonable
notice,
an
opportunity
to
show
cause
to
the
contrary,
and,
if
requested,
a
hearing.</p>
