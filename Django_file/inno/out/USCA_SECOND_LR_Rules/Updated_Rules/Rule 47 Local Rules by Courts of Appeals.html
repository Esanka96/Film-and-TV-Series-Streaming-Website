<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(a)
Local
Rules.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(1)
Each
court
of
appeals
acting
by
a
majority
of
its
judges
in
regular
active
service
may,
after
giving
appropriate
public
notice
and
opportunity
for
comment,
make
and
amend
rules
governing
its
practice.
A
generally
applicable
direction
to
parties
or
lawyers
regarding
practice
before
a
court
must
be
in
a
local
rule
rather
than
an
internal
operating
procedure
or
standing
order.
A
local
rule
must
be
consistent
with
--
but
not
duplicative
of
--
Acts
of
Congress
and
rules
adopted
under
28
U.S.C.
ยง
2072
and
must
conform
to
any
uniform
numbering
system
prescribed
by
the
Judicial
Conference
of
the
United
States.
Each
circuit
clerk
must
send
the
Administrative
Office
of
the
United
States
Courts
a
copy
of
each
local
rule
and
internal
operating
procedure
when
it
is
promulgated
or
amended.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent1">(2)
A
local
rule
imposing
a
requirement
of
form
must
not
be
enforced
in
a
manner
that
causes
a
party
to
lose
rights
because
of
a
nonwillful
failure
to
comply
with
the
requirement.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(b)
Procedure
When
There
Is
No
Controlling
Law.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A
court
of
appeals
may
regulate
practice
in
a
particular
case
in
any
manner
consistent
with
federal
law,
these
rules,
and
local
rules
of
the
circuit.
No
sanction
or
other
disadvantage
may
be
imposed
for
noncompliance
with
any
requirement
not
in
federal
law,
federal
rules,
or
the
local
circuit
rules
unless
the
alleged
violator
has
been
furnished
in
the
particular
case
with
actual
notice
of
the
requirement.</p>
