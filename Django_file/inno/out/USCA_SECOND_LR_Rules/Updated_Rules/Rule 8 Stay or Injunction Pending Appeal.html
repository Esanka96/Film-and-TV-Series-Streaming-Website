<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent3">(A)
The
motion
must:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent4">(i)
show
that
moving
first
in
the
district
court
would
be
impracticable;
or</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent4">(ii)
state
that,
a
motion
having
been
made,
the

denied
the

or
failed
to
afford
the
relief
requested
and
state
any

<p>
</p>

<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent3">(D)
A
motion
under
this
Rule
8(a)(2)
must
be
filed
with
the
circuit
clerk
and
normally
will
be
considered
by
a
panel
of
the
court.
But
in
an
exceptional
case
in
which
time
requirements
make
that
procedure
impracticable,
the
motion
may
be
made
to
and
considered
by
a
single
judge.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p
class="subpage_paragraph_indent3">(E)
The
court
may
condition
relief
on
a
party's
filing
a
bond
or
other
security
in
the
district
court.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>(b)
Proceeding
Against
a
Security
Provider.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If
a
party
gives
security
with
one
or
more
security
providers,
each
provider
submits
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
and
irrevocably
appoints
the
district
clerk
as
its
agent
on
whom
any
papers
affecting
its
liability
on
the
security
may
be
served.
On
motion,
a
security
providerâs
liability
may
be
enforced
in
the
district
court
without
the
necessity
of
an
independent
action.
The
motion
and
any
notice
that
the
district
court
prescribes
may
be
served
on
the
district
clerk,
who
must
promptly
send
a
copy
to
each
security
provider
whose
address
is
known.</p>

<p><strong>(c)

<p>
</p>
<p>Rule
38

the
Federal

Criminal
Procedure

a
stay
in
a
criminal
case.</p>
